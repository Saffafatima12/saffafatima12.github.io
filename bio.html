  <h1>About the Artist</h1>

  <p>
    I’m Saffa, a process engineer and oil painter based in Budapest. I create slow, intuitive works
    that explore calm, light, and emotional landscapes. Each painting is entirely original,
    and I enjoy sharing my artistic journey with viewers and collectors alike.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m inspired by stillness, memory, and inner worlds — and my aim with each piece
    is to invite the viewer into a quiet moment of reflection.
